0.01
Initial alpha release, highscores are broken, there is a few bugs in the collision detection, and performance is bad.

0.02
Initial highscore support

0.03
Replaced all timer code with two global variables, instead of every object keeping track of its own time which only uses additional resources and makes the game out of sync.
Minor fixes
Fixed the "lives left" text.
Fixed bug in highscores so it only showed up first time
Added settings.cfg and support for loading and saving settings.

0.03b
Fixed bug that made it impossible to change level, added a nonpausing tick variable

Made highscore listing look better.

0.04
Using lists for effects and balls instead, for more effective management of collision detection.
Optimized a bit here and there.

0.05
Optimizing overall, code cleanup, not drawing the screen every time the simulation runs

fixed missing texture in sound-options
game should now be optimized enough to be playable on most modern machines
removed joystick init from sdl because it is not used

0.05b
fixing non-bug where a ball hits two bricks at the same time, and changing direction because hit detection is done at the first brick, and then at the second brick, it detects the ball as hitting the brick on another surface than what whould see realistic (this is not really a bug, but it looks better.)
removing unused -lglut from makefile, it is not used.

0.05c
Optimizing a bit
Made aim user controlled, using the mousewheel to aim.

Collision detection improved. (ball wont deflect off two sides at the same time, which was annoying!)

Slow/Fast ball poweups wont be added, since there is allready "Small balls"/"Normal balls" and "Big Balls" powerups that do about the same thing.

Initial sound support.
stereo option, to turn off stereo sound.
Produced and found soundeffects which are under a free license (read data/snd/LICENSE.txt)
 -- The sound effort is not good, if you are able to create/collect a better set, please do!

Stuff that needs doing some time:
Get more liniar increase in difficulty by sorting/adding/removing levels.
